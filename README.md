 Displaying Iterated Function Systems as point clouds

 Use the left/right arrow keys to change fractal, the number of points is equal to 3^FRACTAL_ITERATIONS, feel free to increase or decrease the value of FRACTAL_ITERATIONS in main.cpp.
 
## Building
 You'll need the Vulkan SDK, you can find it over at https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home. The Vulkan SDK should include these optional components:
  - GLM Headers
  - VMA header

 If you have the SDK but you don't have these headers you can just use the maintenancetool program in the SDK to add them.
 
 Download CMake at https://cmake.org/download/ and run the CMakeLists.txt file with it.
